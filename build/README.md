# Build Directory

This directory contains build configuration and legacy files.

## Current Files

- **`.gitignore`** - Git ignore rules for build outputs
- **`version.json.old`** - Legacy version file (not used anymore)

## Note

Build scripts have been moved to project-specific directories:
- Desktop project: `../src/Haihv.Vbdlis.Tools/Haihv.Vbdlis.Tools.Desktop/build-scripts/`

Each project now manages its own:
- Build scripts (Windows/macOS)
- Version tracking
- Release process
